# FunctionalAreas

Hi everyone, this is my first project. I'm not a professional developer and I find it difficult to keep up, so I'm offering it for free to users so they can improve it.

I don't know what version it is exactly, as I had several copies that I modified and didn't organize them efficiently. I've reviewed the code to see if the pearl locking feature is implemented. This caused high latency on the server because it was checking each player's tick or something similar. Please try to improve the system.

I'll leave it in your hands. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to contact to me on my discord's group.
